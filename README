"""
An easy-to-use Django forms integration of the reCaptcha service.


To use, simply base your form off the ``RecaptchaForm`` class. This class adds
a new argument that must be provided to the form, ``remote_ip``.

Two settings which must be set in your project's ``settings`` module are 
``RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY`` and ``RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY``, the public and private
keys for your domain, respectively. 

Following is an example of creating a basic comment form class and then
using an instance of the form in a view::

    from django import forms
    from mysite.utils import recaptcha

    class CommentForm(recaptcha.RecaptchaForm):
        name = forms.CharField()
        comment = forms.CharField(widget=Textarea())
        captcha = recaptcha.RecaptchaField()

    def comment(request):
        comment_form = CommentForm(remote_ip=request.META['REMOTE_ADDR'])
        ...

If you need to use a different base form (such as ``ModelForm``), use multiple
inheritance like so::

    class MyModelForm(BaseRecaptchaForm, ModelForm):
        ...
